Applied Data Science Program: Leveraging AI for Effective Decision-Making

In a linear regression model preparation, the key for finding the best possible model is reducing the error between the predicted values and the actual values. 
This is done through a loss function calculation of Mean Squared Error (MSE). The goal in these project is to minimize MSE, 
which means reducing the average squared error across all data points. The smaller the MSE, the better the modelâ€™s predictions are.

### Capston Project: Used Car Price Prediction Model
Creating an ML Model for used car market to predict the used car prices.
Techniques used to solve that problem are:

- Data analysis
- EDA:
  - Univariate data analysis
  - Bevariate data analysis
  - Correlation analysis using heatmap
  - Feature engineering
- Data splitting to:
  - training data
  - testing data
- Linear Regession
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Statical Analysis

### Elective Project: Boston Housing Price Prediction Project
Creating an ML Model for predicting house prices using training dataset.
The final trained model will be use to predict the parice.
