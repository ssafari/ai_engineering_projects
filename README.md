Applied Data Science Program: Leveraging AI for Effective Decision-Making

In a linear regression model preparation, the key for finding the best possible model is reducing the error between the predicted values and the actual values. 
This is done through a loss function calculation of Mean Squared Error (MSE). The goal in these project is to minimize MSE, which means reducing the average 
squared error across all data points. The smaller the MSE, the better the modelâ€™s predictions are. This is where we optimize linear equation parameters by
using the most common optimization technique the gradient descent.  After multiple iterations of gradient descent, the final model converges, meaning the 
parameters no longer change significantly, and the MSE is minimized.

### Cost function in linear regression:

- ***Mean Square Error (MSE)***
- ***Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*** - useful when dealing with outliers or when we want a simpler interpretation of error.
- ***Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)*** - measure of error that maintains sensitivity to larger mistakes making it suitable for many regression tasks.
- ***R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)*** - It is a widely used metric for evaluating the explanatory power of a linear regression model. It is useful for linear regression models where the relationship between the variables is non-linear.
